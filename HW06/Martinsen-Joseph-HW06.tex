\begin{problem} (5 points) 
Section 5.1, Exercise 50, page 331
\end{problem}
\begin{solution} \ \\
In the basis step of this proof, there is an error. $$\displaystyle \dfrac{(1 + \frac{1}{2})^2}{2} = \left(\dfrac{3}{2} \right)^2 \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{9}{8}$$ and $$\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^1 i = 1$$ are not true or equal as stated.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (15 points) 
Section 5.2, Exercise 4, pages 341--342
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}\ \\
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item \ \\
  \underline{\textbf{Basis Step}} \\
  $P(18):  1 \cdot 4$ cent stamps and $2 \cdot 7$ cent stamps \\
  $P(19):  3 \cdot 4$ cent stamps and $1 \cdot 7$ cent stamps \\
  $P(20):  5 \cdot 4$ cent stamps and $0 \cdot 7$ cent stamps \\
  $P(21):  0 \cdot 4$ cent stamps and $3 \cdot 7$ cent stamps
  
  \item
  The inductive hypothesis of this proof is as follows. Any $j \cent $ postage stamp can be made from a combination of $4\cent$ and $7\cent$ stamps for all $j$ stamps with $ 18 \leq k$. where $k \ge 21$.
  
  \item
  In order to prove the inductive step, show that $k+1 \cent$ stamps can be made from $4\cent$ and $7 \cent$ stamps.
  
  \item
  With $k \ge 21$, $P(k-3)$ has been shown to be true by the inductive hypothesis. Adding another $4 \cent$ stamp, it must follow that $P(k+1)$ is also true. 
  
  \item
  With the basis step and the inductive step shown to be valid, $P$ has been proved to hold for $n \ge 21$ by strong induction.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem} (10 points)
Section 5.2, Exercise 30, page 344
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}\ \\
The basis step shows that $a^0 = 1$. The correct induction hypothesis would be $a^0 = 1$ not $a^j = 1$. The incorrect inductive hypothesis is used in this proof.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (30 points)
Section 5.3, Exercise 6, page 357.
To prove that your formula is valid, use mathematical induction.
For the invalid recursive definitions, explain why they are invalid.

\begin{problem} (15 points)
Section 5.3, Exercise 16, page 358 (use mathematical induction)
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}  \ \\
$f_n$ is the $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number. \\
\textbf{Assume} $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - \dots - f_{2n-1} + f_{2n} = f_{2n-1} - 1 $ for $n\ge 1$ \\
\textbf{\underline{Basis Step}: Show }$P(1)$ \\
\begin{align*}
P(1) &= f_0 - f_1 + f_2 = 0 - 1 + 1 = 0 \\
P(1) &= f_{2(1) - 1} - 1 = f_1 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0
\end{align*}
$\therefore P(1)$ holds \\
\textbf{\underline{Inductive Step}: Show } $P(k) \rightarrow P(k+1)$ \\
\textbf{Assume} $P(k)$ \textbf{for arbitrary $k \ge  1$} \\
\textbf{Show P(k+1):} \\
\begin{align*}
  f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - \dots - f_{2(k+1)-1} + f_{2(k+1)} &= f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - \\
  & \dots - f_{2k-1} + f_{2k} - f_{2k+1} + f_{2k+2} \\
  &= f_{2k-1} - 1 - f_{2k+1} + f_{2k+2} &\textbf{By Inductive Hypothesis}\\
  &= f_{2k-1} - 1 + f_{2k} \\
  &= f_{2k+1} - 1 &\textbf{By Fib.}\\
  &= f_{2(k+1) - 1} - 1
\end{align*}
$\therefore P(k) \rightarrow P(k+1)$ \textbf{holds}\\
$\therefore$ \textbf{the statement holds for all $n \ge 1 $ by mathematical induction}
