\begin{problem} (16 points) 
Section 6.1, Exercise 24, page 396
\end{problem}
\begin{solution} \ \\
How many positive integers between 1000 and 9999 inclusive
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item are divisible by 9?
  $$\floor*{ \dfrac{9999}{9}} - \floor*{\dfrac{1000-1}{9}} = \floor*{\dfrac{9000}{9}} = 1000$$
  \item are even?
  $$\floor*{ \dfrac{9999}{2}} - \floor*{\dfrac{1000-1}{2}} = \floor*{\dfrac{9000}{2}} = 4500$$
  \item have distinct digits?
  $$9 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 = 4536$$
  \item are not divisible by 3?
  $$9999-999 - \floor*{ \dfrac{9999}{3}} - \floor*{\dfrac{1000-1}{3}} = 1000 - \floor*{\dfrac{9000}{3}} = 6000$$
  \item are divisible by 5 or 7? \\
    Divisible by 5:
    $$\floor*{ \dfrac{9999}{5}} - \floor*{\dfrac{1000}{5}} = 1799$$
    Divisible by 7:
    $$\floor*{ \dfrac{9999}{7}} - \floor*{ \dfrac{1000}{7}} = 1286$$
    Divisible by 5 and 7:
    $$\floor*{ \dfrac{9999}{5\cdot7}} - \floor*{ \dfrac{1000}{5\cdot7}} = 257$$
    divisible by 5 or 7:
    $$1799+1286-257 = 2828$$
  \item are not divisible by either 5 or 7?
  $$9000- 2828 = 6172$$
  \item are divisible by 5 but not by 7?
  $$1799 - 257 = 1542$$
  \item are divisible by 5 and 7?
  $$257$$
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
a) if letters can be repeated?
b) if no letter can be repeated?
c) that start with X, if letters can be repeated?
d) that start with X, if no letter can be repeated?
e) that start and end with X, if letters can be repeated?
f ) that start with the letters BO (in that order), if letters
can be repeated?
g) that start and end with the letters BO (in that order),
if letters can be repeated?
h) that start or end with the letters BO (in that order), if
letters can be repeated?
